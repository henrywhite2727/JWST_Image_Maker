Some things plotting or processing should consider

1. Find the shape of the data.
    a. If it's a 2D image, use one cmap
    b. If it's a 3D image, assume each zlice is of different wavelengths, 
        and use a different cmap + lower alpha for each one NEVERMIND ON THIS
        c. For each zlice, maintain saturation and value but increase hue,
            then create a custom colour map from black to colour to white
2. Remove blank spaces?
    a. Find the x, y values that contain dead pixels and remove the xylices 
        up to those levels?
3. Adjust the brightness values using ALL the data.
    a. Calculate the distribution of all of the particles
    b. If there are any 0 values, set vmin to 1
    c. Multiply each value by a nonlinear factor so that the distribution 
        tends towards Gaussian, with a mean around the midway?
4. Maybe animate in the future?
